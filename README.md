# CointrackAI 

## KIWI Science company task (HTML, CSS)
---

It was necessary to build a responsive web page. A complete model on the Figma platform was provided as a source ([Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/fSfs45rF0HJSUdmLFdUajs/Test-task?node-id=1%3A108&t=1F2nnuODAX0ZCXu0-0)).
I built the page with several levels of adaptability, using mixins for that.

I used Sass for styling.

This project was already deployed with Firebase Hosting service.
